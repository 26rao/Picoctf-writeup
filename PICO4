Plumbing  -general skill
Based on general skill ; asks you to find password using linux commands .To begin with I used nc command to get the data but the file contained recurring data .
Then I used grep command to extract required password and thus the level was cleared.
 
Inspect HTML
In this a website link was provided which had no clear mentioned data ,so on opening source code ..HTML format provided access to the password and hence cleared the stage

FINDME
Find me was one of the most challenging part , After downloading the instance I was taken to a webpage which was asking me to submit the flag,
I tried using various passwords but nothing worked .Even on inspecting the source code I didn’t find anything useful the  I used the url information’
Using base64 decoder I decoded the text and hence got the flag
