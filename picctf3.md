LOCAL AUTHORITY

This challenge comes under the category of WEB EXPLOITATION, and it was
quite easy. We were provided with the link to a particular website
<http://saturn.picoctf.net:59126/> .The website asked us to provide
username and password .But we don’t have any, So I opened the source
code and noticed that it was in the HTML format later typed the same
link using .php extension which gave me access to the source code. The
code contains access to a file named “Secure.js” .This file helps us to
find username and password.Using the password provided we can easily
login and get the flag.I have also attached screenshots for above
mentioned explanation.
